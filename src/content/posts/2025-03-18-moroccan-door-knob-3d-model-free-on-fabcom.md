Introducing my first 3D model—a beautifully crafted Modern Moroccan Door Knob, inspired by the intricate designs and cultural heritage found in Moroccan homes today. This model captures the essence of Moroccan craftsmanship, blending traditional aesthetics with contemporary functionality. Using Megascans materials for realistic textures and Blender for precise modeling, I’ve created a detailed and lifelike representation of this everyday object, showcasing its ornate patterns and elegant form.

The door knob features intricate geometric designs, a hallmark of Moroccan artistry, paired with a modern twist that makes it suitable for today’s interiors. Whether you're a 3D artist, designer, or enthusiast, this model is perfect for adding a touch of cultural elegance to your projects.
