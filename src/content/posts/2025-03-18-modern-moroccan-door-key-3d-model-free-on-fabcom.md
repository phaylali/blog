Introducing my latest 3D creation—a **Modern Moroccan Key**, designed to complement the intricate beauty of Moroccan architecture and decor. This key is inspired by the timeless elegance found in traditional Moroccan homes, blending cultural heritage with a contemporary design twist. Using **Megascans materials** for ultra-realistic textures and **Blender** for meticulous modeling, I’ve crafted a detailed and lifelike representation of this everyday object, highlighting its ornate details and functional charm.

The key features delicate engravings and geometric patterns, a signature of Moroccan artistry, while maintaining a sleek and modern silhouette. Perfect for 3D artists, game developers, or designers, this model adds a touch of authenticity and cultural richness to any project.
