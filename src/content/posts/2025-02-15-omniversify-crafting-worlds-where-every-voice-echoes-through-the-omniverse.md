\### **Introduction: A Call to Moroccan Dreamers, Creators, and Storytellers**

Imagine a world where the myths whispered by your grandparents, the untold battles of Moroccan resistance fighters, and the vibrant tapestries of Amazigh traditions are not just remembered—they are _immortalized_. A world where games become portals to dimensions where our stories reign supreme, challenging the narratives that have silenced us for centuries. This is the vision of **Omniversify**, a groundbreaking Moroccan game development studio born to amplify the voices the world has tried to forget.

We are not just building games. We are reclaiming history, culture, and identity. And we need _you_—the artists, programmers, musicians, writers, historians, and visionaries—to join us in this revolution.

\---

\### **What is Omniversify?**

Derived from the theory of the _Omniverse_—the idea of infinite coexisting realities—Omniversify is a movement to ensure _our_ realities are seen, heard, and felt. Our mission is simple yet radical: **to challenge dominant perspectives and elevate the stories erased by colonialism, neglect, or prejudice**. Through immersive video games, we will celebrate Morocco’s multicultural legacy, amplify the Global South’s silenced histories, and unite communities through shared creativity.

\---

\### **Our Mission: Deserted Tales, Omniversal Voices**

For too long, the world’s stories have been filtered through a narrow lens. Western narratives paint heroes in their image, reducing ours to footnotes or caricatures. Omniversify exists to flip this script. We focus on:

\- **Amazigh Heritage**: Promoting Tifinagh, the Amazigh language, and dismantling divisive myths that seek to separate Amazigh identity from Morocco’s soul.

\- **North African Unity**: Bridging cultures across the Maghreb and Africa, showcasing shared histories of resilience.

\- **Global South Solidarity**: From Arab folklore to African mythologies, we illuminate stories that textbooks ignore.

Our games are more than entertainment—they are acts of resistance. They blend history, fantasy, and cultural truth to create worlds where players don’t just _see_ our perspectives—they _live_ them.

\---

\### **Our First Saga: _Deserted Tales: Aicha Qandicha_**

In the coastal labyrinth of Portuguese-occupied Mazagan (modern El Jadida), our debut game begins not with a legend, but with a nameless warrior. By day, she is an ordinary girl of incredible beauty; by night, she leads **The Argan Vanguard**, a clandestine resistance cell operating in the shadows.

**The Argan Vanguard**:

Modeled after the ruthless efficiency of Skyrim’s Dark Brotherhood or the Hidden Ones of _Assassin’s Creed Mirage_, this group is a whisper in the wind. Their existence is a rumor even among the broader Moroccan resistance—a scattered coalition of Amazigh tribes, Arab fighters, and Moorish refugees fleeing the ashes of Al-Andalus. The Argan Vanguard strikes without warning, sabotaging colonizer supply lines and vanishing into the night. Their methods are brutal, their morality ambiguous. To the Portuguese, they are ghosts. To the Moroccan resistance army, they are neither allies nor enemies—just a necessary storm.

**Her Origin**:

The protagonist’s father, a Moorish refugee, fled the Reconquista’s violence and found love in the Souss region, marrying the daughter of a tribal leader. Their children—our heroine, her siblings, and young nephews—lived in fragile peace until Portuguese soldiers burned their town to ash. Only she and her fiancé survive.

**The Co-Leader: A Love Forged in Fire**

Her second-in-command is more than a partner—he is her equal, a warrior whose loyalty borders on devotion. Their bond is unspoken but unbreakable: he would die for her, and she would burn the world to protect him. Together, they mastermind guerrilla strikes, their love a quiet rebellion against the despair around them.

**The Final Act: Battle of the Three Kings**

As the game crescendos, the Argan Vanguard’s actions culminate in the historic 1578 Battle of the Three Kings. Here, the heroine’s quest for vengeance collides with Morocco’s fight for sovereignty. In the chaos, she confronts the traitor Al-Mutawakil, drowning him in a river—an act that births the myth of “Aicha Qandicha.” But her name, like her legacy, remains shrouded. Players will only learn her mythical title in the game’s closing moments, as her story fades into folklore.

\### **The _Deserted Tales_ Series: A Franchise of Forgotten Legends**

_Deserted Tales: Aicha Qandicha_ is just the beginning. Like _Assassin’s Creed_ or _The Elder Scrolls_, the _Deserted Tales_ series will explore untold histories and mythologies across Morocco, North Africa, and the Global South. Each game will be a standalone masterpiece, connected by the shared mission of amplifying marginalized voices.

**Upcoming Titles**:

\- **Deserted Tales: The Sword of Allah**: A tactical RPG following Khalid ibn al-Walid’s undefeated campaigns, blending historical strategy with mythic grandeur.

\- **Deserted Tales: Amazigh Dawn**: A fantasy epic where ancient Berber deities reawaken to defend Morocco from colonial invaders.

\- **Deserted Tales: Echoes of Al-Andalus**: A narrative-driven game set in the fractured alliances and cultural golden age of Islamic Spain.

Each project will spotlight marginalized voices, partnering with historians, linguists, and grassroots communities to ensure authenticity.

\### **Join the Omniverse: We Need Your Fire**

Omniversify is not a studio—it’s a **collaborative uprising**. We seek raw, passionate talent eager to grow while reshaping narratives. No polished resumes required—just a hunger to create.

**Who We’re Looking For**:

\- **Artists & 3D Modelers**: Bring Amazigh symbols, Moroccan architecture, and African landscapes to life.

\- **Musicians & Sound Designers**: Fuse Gnawa rhythms, Andalusian melodies, and desert winds into haunting soundtracks.

\- **Writers & Historians**: Dive into archives and oral histories to craft stories that resonate with truth.

\- **Programmers & Game Devs**: Build engines for worlds that defy colonial logic.

\- **Voice Actors & Narrators**: Speak Tifinagh, Darija, and Arabic in games where language is power.

This is your chance to immortalize your culture while honing your craft. Together, we’ll turn “deserted tales” into universes.

\### **Why Morocco? Why Now?**

Morocco is a microcosm of the Omniverse—a crossroads of Arab, Amazigh, African, and Mediterranean influences. Yet our stories are often diluted or exploited. Games like _Deserted Tales: Aicha Qandicha_ are our answer: proof that we can weaponize creativity to reclaim our past and inspire our future.

Colonialism stole our wealth; let’s reclaim our _narrative wealth_.

Bring your rage, your hope, your half-finished demos. Let’s weaponize creativity.

\---

\### **Let’s Omniversify It**

The gaming world is ready for a revolution. Not a “clash of civilizations,” but a symphony of them. To Moroccan creatives: your ideas, your heritage, and your voice are the missing notes in this symphony.

The gaming world is saturated with the same stories, the same faces, the same lies. Omniversify is a revolt—a declaration that our tales _deserve_ AAA budgets, global platforms, and legendary status.

Morocco’s youth have spent generations being told to “fit in.” We say: **“Burn the mold.”**

Join Omniversify. Let’s build games where Aicha Qandicha’s legacy is just the beginning. Let’s ensure our stories aren’t universal—they’re **omniversal**.
